SDLC
Waterfall vs Agile vs DevOps vs DevSecOps vs AiOps

SDLC
-------
Requirements analysis
Planning
Design --> General requirements to technical requirements
Implementation
Deployment
Testing
Maintaince


waterfall
===========
once requirements are fixed we can't change
2 years project to go for PROD


Agile
===========
Final product --> multiple modules --> sprints

login and signup --> sprint-1 --> 30 days
orders
menu
payment
shipping
cart
reviews
employees



sprint-1
----------
clients UAT(user acceptance testing)

daily standups --> 

95% --> 5 defects, 1 invalid defect

sprint-2 --> orders + 4 defects

15 days 15 days testing and deployment


DevOps is the process of building, deploying and testing the code written by developer on the same day instead of doing after complete development.. we can acheive this using continous integration, continous deployment, continous delivery and continous testing. 
We can do faster releases with less defect using DevOps... basically automation mindset to get the best results

DEV, QA, SIT, UAT, PERF, PRE-PROD, PROD



Linux --> Linus torvalds
=================
UNIX --> Hardware and Software(Unix OS) together
CPU, RAM, Hard Disk, OS(Software)
Laptop --> IBM BIOS

Linux --> from the sratch using C language based on unix principles. He invented git to store this

windows
-----------
not open source
costly
not secure must install anti virus
slow
too many graphics
frequent restarts
tough to update/upgrade

Linux --> 9MB
Secure
high speed --> mostly text
no need of restarts
install or update packages is easy
free, community support
low resources
